# MLX Katalog

MLX Katalog is a project to hold the default content to bootstrap Machine Learning Exchange. 

## Pipelines

You can upload files under [pipeline-samples](pipeline-samples) to the Machine Learning Exchange 
Components page to register a new component.

Sample Pipelines: monitor_quality, monitor_fairness, wml_train
   
## Pipeline Components
You can upload files under [component-samples](component-samples) to the Machine Learning Exchange 
Components page to register a new component.

Sample Components: monitor_quality, monitor_fairness, wml_train

## Models

You can upload files under [model-samples](model-samples) to the Machine Learning 
Exchange model page to register a new model.

Sample Models: image-completer

## Datasets

You can upload files under [dataset-samples](model-samples) to the Machine Learning 
Exchange Datasets page to register a new Dataset.

Sample Models: image-completer

## Notebooks

You can upload files under [model-samples](model-samples) to the Machine Learning 
Exchange Notebooks page to register a new notebook.

Sample Notebooks: [Watson-ML-pipeline](notebook-samples/Watson-ML-pipeline/watson-ml-pipeline.ipynb) is simple end to end pipeline notebook that trains a model on Watson Machine Learning. Then it stores and deploys the trained model as web service on Watson Machine Learning.
